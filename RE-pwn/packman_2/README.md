## Hint

Ask Mr.John in the shadows

## Solution

First extract the given zip file. It will contain a binary file. Running <code>file</code> command on the given binary reveals that the given file is a firmware image. Now using <code>binwalk -e</code>, we can unpack the given firmware.

Now we are required to find the root password. <code>/etc/shadow</code> is a text file that contains information about the systemâ€™s users' passwords(Given hint also mentions this). To obtain this, first extract <code>squashfs</code> file using <code>unsquashfs</code> command. Inside the extracted file system, we can find the shadow file inside <code>/etc</code> folder. Using tool like [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) to crack the password, we get <code>ismart12</code> as password. This doesn't require using any wordlist since the password is short.
