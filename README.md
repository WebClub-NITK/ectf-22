# Engineer CTF 2022 Editorials

**eCTF** is an annual Capture The Flag event organized by the **Systems Special Interest Group** of [Web Enthusiasts' Club, NITK](https://instagram.com/wecnitk). The 2022 edition was held on 5th March 2022. We had an overwhelming **700+ users registering** for the event ðŸ¤©. A huge shoutout to all the participants for their enthusiasm in solving the challenges and making this event a huge success! (Í â‰– ÍœÊ–Í â‰–)ðŸ‘Œ

For all those fellows who couldn't solve some of the questions or make it to the event, don't worry, we've got you covered! We sincerely hope that you were able to take something away from the CTF! (>â€¿â— )âœŒHere are the editorials for the ECTF 2022 questions!
