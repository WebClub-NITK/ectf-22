# WEC CTF 2022

A repository used in the planning of WEC CTF 2022

## Guidelines for adding a challenge

1. Make a directory for each challenge in the respective category-directory. Everything related to that challenge should be present in that directory.
2. For each challenge-dir, create a README. Specify what is to be uploaded onto the website. 
	* Eg: For pwn, generally both executable and C-sourcefile are uploaded, but for RE only executable is uploaded. 
	* So, need to be clear on what is given to participants to solve that challenge.
	* And anything about the chal you feel is important, add here. 

3. If you want to provide any huge files then upload them to your drive and provide a link to that files.
4. Create a pull-request. Some of us will take a look at the challenge and then add it to the repo. **Do not push the challenge directly. It needs to be verified before it is added**.

**Note** : Strictly follow the guidelines. Let us keep the repo clean.
