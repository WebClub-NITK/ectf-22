# TVA's Trap

Author: Vinayak Vatsalya J

Flag: `CTF{w3c-ctf-z0z2_3ry9t0}`

## Problem Statement
  
Nadia is caught in a time loop as the guest of honor at a seemingly inescapable party one night in New York City. In order to get out she has to decode the following text message she gets. The TVA being noobs donâ€™t understand that just encoding is not exactly secure. Can you get the flag and help Nadia get to base ?

 - Reverse search the first line of this challenge to get a clue. 

## Solution
The flag can be obtained decoding the text which is encoded in base64 in `8-6-4.txt` file 8 times (each time the new text to be decoded is the previous decoded text).<br>
